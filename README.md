2. Share the project details in your email:
You can either:

Mention it in the body of your email (a few lines), OR

Provide a link if you have uploaded it somewhere (GitHub, Google Drive, etc.).

Example sentence you can use:

"I have worked on a Smart House Price Predictor project where I built a machine learning model to predict property prices using regression techniques. (Portfolio Link: [your link if available])"

3. If you don't have it uploaded yet:

Consider uploading your code/project to GitHub (it's very professional!).

Or prepare a simple PDF that describes your project + screenshots of code/output.
